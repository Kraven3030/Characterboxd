    ABOUT

Characterboxd is a web application that allows users who have a passion for films & tv to read or create reviews for their favorite shows and movies.



    APPROACH

We wanted to make something simple and easy for any user to use. This meant that the site needed to be sleek and modern with links or buttons perfectly placed and visible to make the site easy to navigate. To this we utilized Bootstrap which in turn made the application responsive for the users using any device.
